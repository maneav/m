It is a combination of bare metal and servers hosted in Certified Data Centers around the globe. Due to this geographical redundancy we can ensure that the pool stays online even if one data center suffers from an outage. Working closely with the Cardano community from the beginning, allowed us to fine tune and improve our servers day-by-day. With over 20 years of experience working mostly on MacOS and Linux, we are utilizing the best security, and monitoring practices to provide our delegators the best return possible.",
